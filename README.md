# InceptionGCN

This project extends Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) for applications in brain connectomics, and also compares the performance of our model against BrainNetCNN - a popular model used for brain connectome classification.

## Two parts of the project:

1: Compare BrainNetCNN with Graph Convolutional Network on ABIDE data set. You will have to download the ABIDE data set from their website in order for the code to work.

2: Extend the GCN to our proposed IGCN model, and compare performance with GCN. 

More details about the project will come in next commit.
Detailed publication of our proposed model will be published separately.
